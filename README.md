## About Me

Hello, I am Cameron Davis and i am a Full Stack Web Developer in training. I have a long history with being passionate about technology and computers. Recently was looking at a change in my career as i didn't do anything with my Criminal Justice degree that i obtained in 2015 and figured that i wanted to dive into a career in the tech field as that was where my passion was. I have never touched a piece of code before i started at the UT Texas Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp.
